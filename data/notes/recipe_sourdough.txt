Sourdough Bread Recipe - My Favorite Method

Ingredients:
- 500g bread flour
- 350g water (70% hydration)
- 100g active sourdough starter
- 10g salt

Equipment:
- Dutch oven
- Mixing bowl
- Bench scraper
- Proofing basket (banneton)

Instructions:

Day 1 - Evening:
1. Mix flour and water, let rest 30 minutes (autolyse)
2. Add starter and salt, mix until combined
3. Perform stretch and folds every 30 minutes for 2 hours (4 sets total)
4. Bulk fermentation: let dough rise at room temperature (75°F) for 4-6 hours
   or until doubled in size
5. Pre-shape the dough into a round, rest 20 minutes
6. Final shape and place in floured banneton
7. Cover and refrigerate overnight (12-16 hours cold proof)

Day 2 - Morning:
1. Preheat oven to 500°F with Dutch oven inside for 45 minutes
2. Score the dough with a razor blade or sharp knife
3. Bake covered at 500°F for 20 minutes
4. Remove lid, reduce to 450°F, bake 20-25 minutes until deep golden
5. Cool on wire rack for at least 1 hour before cutting

Tips:
- The starter should be at peak activity (doubled in size, bubbly)
- Use the poke test to check proofing: poke the dough, it should
  slowly spring back but leave a slight indent
- Higher hydration gives more open crumb but is harder to handle
- Cold proofing in the fridge for 12-16 hours develops better flavor
- The internal temperature should reach 205-210°F when done
