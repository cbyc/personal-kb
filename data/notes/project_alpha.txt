Project Alpha - Internal Planning Document

Project Alpha is a customer-facing web application for inventory management.
The project was initiated on January 15, 2024 by the engineering team.

Team Members:
- Sarah Chen (Tech Lead)
- Marcus Johnson (Backend Developer)
- Priya Patel (Frontend Developer)
- Alex Rivera (QA Engineer)

Key Deadlines:
- MVP deadline: March 30, 2024
- Beta release: May 15, 2024
- Production launch: July 1, 2024

Technology Stack:
- Backend: Python with FastAPI
- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Cache: Redis
- Deployment: Kubernetes on AWS

Architecture Decisions:
The team decided to use a microservices architecture with three main services:
1. Inventory Service - handles CRUD operations for inventory items
2. Notification Service - sends alerts when stock is low
3. Reporting Service - generates inventory reports

The API follows REST conventions with OpenAPI documentation.
Authentication uses OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens.

Current Status:
As of February 2024, the Inventory Service is 70% complete.
The team is blocked on the database migration strategy.
Marcus is evaluating whether to use Alembic or custom migration scripts.

Risks:
- Database migration complexity could delay the MVP
- Third-party API integration with suppliers is behind schedule
- Performance testing has not yet started
